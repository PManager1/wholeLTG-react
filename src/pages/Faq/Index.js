              <p className="quote-p">I lived in the house for 32 years, and spent the last three years trying to fix it up and sell. Finally, I had to sell it quickly and was tired of putting money into rehabbing the house, plus traveling more than 65 miles to work each day. A friend of mine encouraged me to call even though I really didn’t have an ugly house. They saw the care and the work that I put into the house, and they made me a great offer. HomeVestors was my answer! — Brenda T. </p>

                    Need to sell an inherited property quickly.
                    Want to unload a rental property with problem renters.
                    Relocating or job transfer.
                    Going through a divorce.
                    Falling behind on mortgage payments and facing possible foreclosure.
                    Not wanting to deal with a structural or repair issues.
                    Simply moving, but not wanting to mess with repairs, painting, or cleaning.

                    After buying 100,000 homes, we have estimating down to a science. Before making you an offer, the franchisee in your market will evaluate a number of factors, including the following:
                    The current condition of your house.
                    The approximate cost of repairs and renovations required.
                    The amount of time it will take to renovate your house.
                    The future “post-renovation” value of your house, compared to other homes in the area.
                    The amount of real estate commissions required to sell your home after renovation.
                    The cost of maintaining the house until it’s ready to sell, including insurance, utilities, taxes, loan payments, and more.
                    The estimated future “post-renovation” value of your renovated house, minus these costs, helps us arrive at the cash offer that we make.

                    The phrase ‘We Buy Ugly Houses’ lets sellers know that we are willing to buy houses that are either in poor condition or, for one reason or another, might not be attractive to all buyers. This includes some of the following reasons:
                    Houses with serious structural issues such as foundation, roof, plumbing, or electrical problems.
                    Houses located in less than desirable or high-crime neighborhoods.
                    Houses that are located in flood plain or in areas prone to the effects of weather.
                    Houses with high-interest rates or undesirable mortgage financing.
                    Houses with payments or balances that are too high for the owner to handle.
                    Houses that have bad memories for the homeowner, such as a death, divorce, or tragedy.
                    Houses that no longer serve the needs of the homeowner — too big, too small, inconvenient location, and so on.
